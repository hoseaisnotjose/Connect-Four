# Connect-Four
Connect-Four Project 1

Welcome to my first game - Connect Four! 

Connect Four is a "solved game" in that the first player can win by playing the right moves. Connect Four was first sold under the Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley, a now defunct board game company.

This game is easy to play. The following are the rules:

1) The objective of the player is to be the first one to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs
2) The player will initially have chosen thier own discs
3) There are two assigned disks that are different colors 
4) On this game, the disks are either green or red


Enjoy!
