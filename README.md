# Connect-Four
Connect-Four Project 1

Welcome to my first game project - Connect Four! 

Connect Four is a "solved game" in that the first player can win by playing the right moves. Connect Four was first sold under the Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley, a now defunct board game company.

This game is easy to play. The following are the rules:

1) The objective of the player is to be the first one to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs
2) The player will initially have chosen their own discs
3) There are two assigned disks that are different colors 
4) On this game, the disks are either green or red

Hurdles
1) Having to learn the game for the first time
2) Creating game board using JS to ensure my conditionals ran through each "null" array to check if circles were taken
3) Winning check

Lesson Learned
1) Conceptualize and write down ideas as soon as project is announced
2) And WIREFRAME
3) Time management! Learn to prioritize, allocate wisely
4) Practice! Practice! PRACTICE what is covered and beyond

Future plans
1) Complete any pending styles and functionality
2) Create an option for human vs computer
3) Add special effects such as music and celebratory effects for player that won "x" times

Stay tuned for updates and enhancements!

Enjoy!
